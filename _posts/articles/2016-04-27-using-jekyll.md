## General Thoughts About Using Jekyll
Using Jekyll is another way of making a website. A person who isn't familiar with HTML can easily make a website.
Coding in markdown has proved easy in some ways because I can write in English and not worry about making sure it will render on the page.
Markdown has proved challenging sometimes with making lists, I spent hours trying to make sure that it rendered and it took a while but I finally figured it out.

I would recommend using Jekyll to friends and family who would want to build a website on their own. Jekyll can be used by people who are or aren't used to seeing code.
