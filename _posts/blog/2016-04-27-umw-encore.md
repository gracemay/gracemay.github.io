[UMW Encore! Demo](https://cpsc350-gmay.c9users.io/) A website made during the Basic Flask and Flask PostgreSQL Rudiments for the UMW Encore! Club on campus.

## Steps to Building a Flask Website
1. Set up Cloud9.
2. Install PostgreSQL for the database.
3. Copy an HTML template to use for website.
4. Add pages and code in HTML on Cloud9
5. Write the back-end database code to add information to the database in Python.
6. Create pages to emulate what the website is about.
7. Also add pictures, videos etc. to the pages.

## What I learned:
#### The Good
* Adding pages to a site are easy.
* Adding paragraphs and videos are also easy.
* Inserting information into the database, using the right query was easier.

#### The Bad
* Formatting pictures on a website so that the image is not too large or too small is a challenge.
* If a checkbox or a radio button was clicked, apparent on the Donate page, then make sure that is shown after the submit button is pushed.

#### The Ugly
* Making sure that the right information from the database was being displayed correctly.
